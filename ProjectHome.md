For our software project, we would like to write a named-entity tagger for Persian and for a contrasting language. To start, Omid has already begun developing a named-entity tagger for Persian. Its strategy consists of both gazetteers and regular expressions which work together to tag specific entity types in the text. We will work on improving this tagger and then look for methods that will transfer to the other language.
